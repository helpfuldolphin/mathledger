# ============================================================================
# RFL Experiment: Baseline
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Quick health check for local development and CI smoke tests.
# - Lower replication count (1000 vs 10000) for speed.
# - Fewer experiments per metric.
# - Uses 'percentile' method instead of 'bca' for faster computation.
