# ============================================================================
# RFL Experiment: High Abstention (High Rigor)
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Stricter gating for critical releases or high-stakes validations.
# - Higher confidence level (99%).
# - Stricter pass criteria (Coverage ≥ 0.95).
# - More replicates (20000) to reduce sampling noise.
# - "High Abstention" implies it will likely abstain/fail if signals are weak.
