# Attestation

Dual-root verification, manifest authorship, and cross-ledger proofs reside here:

- Ledger manifest generation and verification
- Merkle boundary alignment between reasoning and UI layers
- Interfaces for external auditors and dual attesters

Artifacts must be derived from deterministic inputs; never hand-edit generated manifests.
