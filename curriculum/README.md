# Curriculum

Curriculum slice definitions, progression logic, and advancement policies live here:

- Formal definitions of learning stages and gating criteria
- Scheduling of RFL loops across cohorts
- Interfaces for monitoring curriculum alignment with the ledger

Treat curriculum specs as code: version them, hash them, and feed them into attestation pipelines.
