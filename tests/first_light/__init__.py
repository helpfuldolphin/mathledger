Phase X P3: First-Light Tests — Design Stubs

This package contains test stubs for the First-Light shadow experiment.
See docs/system_law/Phase_X_P3_Spec.md for the full specification.

IMPORTANT: These tests are Phase X P3 **design stubs**.
They only verify imports and signatures, not real behavior.

SHADOW MODE CONTRACT:
- No governance control or abort logic is tested
- All tests are import/signature smoke checks only
- Full test implementation requires explicit future authorization

Status: DESIGN FREEZE / STUBS ONLY
