            <h1>How the MathLedger Demo Explains Itself</h1>
<strong>Status: LOCKED (v0.2.13)</strong>
<p>This document accompanies the front-facing demo. It explains what the demo enforces, what it refuses to do, and why those refusals are the point.</p>
<strong>Non-Claims</strong>: This demo does not demonstrate intelligence, alignment, forecasting accuracy, or agent performance. It demonstrates governance invariants only.
<hr>
<h2>How Claims Are Introduced, Tested, and Closed</h2>
<p>MathLedger evolves through discrete claim promotion cycles.</p>
<p>This demo represents the current result of such a cycle.</p>
<p>The system does not attempt to implement every idea in its design materials at once. Instead, it advances by introducing narrow claims, subjecting them to hostile review, and closing them only when contradictions are exhausted.</p>
<p>This process is deliberate.</p>
<h3>Two Kinds of Pressure</h3>
<p>MathLedger development operates under two fundamentally different forms of pressure:</p>
<h4>Phase II — Internal Constraint Pressure (Design Grief)</h4>
<p>The Field Manual (fm.tex / fm.pdf) is not a roadmap. It is a pressure map.</p>
<p>It encodes mutually incompatible obligations:
<ul><li>invariants that demand different data structures,</li><li>governance rules that conflict with liveness,</li><li>auditability constraints that fight scalability,</li><li>formal verification assumptions that contradict learning dynamics.</li></ul>
Phase II pressure does not come from implementation difficulty. It comes from collision.</p>
<p>Pressure activates only when a specific obligation is selected for implementation. At that moment, incompatibilities must be confronted, tradeoffs acknowledged, and losses accepted.</p>
<p>This is design grief.</p>
<h4>Phase I — External Adversarial Pressure (Truth Discovery)</h4>
<p>Once a claim is chosen, it is:
<ul><li>made executable,</li><li>published,</li><li>and subjected to hostile external review.</li></ul>
Auditors are encouraged to:
<ul><li>break assumptions,</li><li>find contradictions,</li><li>and attempt replay or misuse.</li></ul>
A claim survives Phase I only if hostile review can no longer produce blocking failures.</p>
<p>This is truth discovery.</p>
<h3>The Claim Promotion Cycle</h3>
<p>MathLedger does not progress linearly. It advances through claim promotion cycles, each with three stages:</p>
<strong>A. Internal Design (Phase II)</strong>
<ul><li>Select one obligation from the Field Manual</li><li>Confront incompatibilities</li><li>Decide what must be sacrificed</li><li>Produce a specific, narrow claim</li></ul>
<strong>B. External Hostility (Phase I)</strong>
<ul><li>Publish the claim</li><li>Subject it to adversarial audit</li><li>Close contradictions or retreat</li></ul>
<strong>C. Closure</strong>
<ul><li>The claim is either enforced, scoped, deferred, or abandoned</li><li>Regression guards are added</li><li>The system stabilizes</li></ul>
Then the cycle repeats.
<p>This alternating structure is intentional. It prevents premature generalization and preserves epistemic honesty.</p>
<h3>Promotion Readiness Checklist</h3>
<p>A change is not eligible to be treated as a promoted claim unless it passes this checklist. This prevents Phase II (ideas) from bleeding into Phase I (public claims) prematurely.</p>
<strong>1) Claim definition is narrow and falsifiable</strong>
<ul><li>The change corresponds to one concrete claim, stated in one sentence.</li><li>It is possible to say what it would mean for that claim to be false.</li></ul>
<strong>2) Claim is classified before implementation</strong>
<p>The claim is labeled as one of:
<ul><li><strong>Enforced (Tier A)</strong>: violation becomes mechanically unavoidable to detect</li><li><strong>Visible (Tier B)</strong>: violation becomes replay-visible but not blocked</li><li><strong>Documented (Tier C)</strong>: explicitly aspirational / deferred</li></ul>
If it is Tier C, it must be presented as deferred—not implied.</p>
<strong>3) No hidden scope expansion</strong>
<p>The change does not silently introduce:
<ul><li>new trust semantics,</li><li>new cryptographic contracts,</li><li>new "correctness" implications,</li><li>or new threat model assumptions</li></ul>
unless these are explicitly stated.</p>
<strong>4) Closure artifacts exist</strong>
<p>At least one of the following must exist before release:
<ul><li>a regression test that fails on reintroduction,</li><li>a build assertion that prevents drift,</li><li>or a hostile audit script check that would catch it.</li></ul>
<strong>5) Public audit path remains executable</strong>
<ul><li>A cold evaluator can follow /docs/for-auditors/ without guessing URLs.</li><li>The verifier self-test remains runnable and interpretable.</li></ul>
<strong>6) Release discipline is satisfied</strong>
<ul><li>The release is versioned, tagged, and pinned.</li><li>/versions/ and /demo/ reflect the same CURRENT version.</li><li>If anything is "out of sync," it must be visibly declared.</li></ul>
If any checklist item fails, the correct outcome is:
<ul><li>defer the claim,</li><li>narrow the claim,</li><li>or refuse the change.</li></ul>
This is how monotone credibility is maintained.</p>
<h3>What This Means for Evaluators</h3>
<p>You may notice:
<ul><li>explicit ABSTAINED outcomes,</li><li>missing features,</li><li>conservative behavior,</li><li>or references to design materials not yet implemented.</li></ul>
This is intentional.</p>
<p>The system prefers refusal with explanation over unjustified output. Only claims that have survived hostile review are enforced.</p>
<h3>What This Process Does NOT Claim</h3>
<p>This process:
<ul><li>does not claim the system is complete,</li><li>does not claim all obligations are compatible,</li><li>does not guarantee correctness beyond stated enforcement,</li><li>and does not rewrite history when mistakes are found.</li></ul>
Instead:
<ul><li>every critique is preserved,</li><li>every fix is versioned,</li><li>and every closed claim remains inspectable.</li></ul>
<strong>In short:</strong> MathLedger improves monotonically not by adding features, but by closing claims under pressure.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What the Demo Is Actually Doing</h2>
<p>The demo separates exploration from authority.</p>
<strong>Exploration phase</strong>: When you enter a problem, the system generates a <code>DraftProposal</code>. This is a set of candidate claims with suggested trust classes. The proposal has a random identifier. Nothing in this phase is committed. You can edit freely. The system makes suggestions. None of it matters yet.
<strong>Authority phase</strong>: When you click "Commit," the system creates a <code>CommittedPartitionSnapshot</code>. This has a content-derived identifier (a hash of what you committed). The claims become immutable. The system records a <code>UVIL_Event</code> documenting your action. Only now do the claims enter the attestation structure.
<p>The boundary is explicit: exploration identifiers never appear in committed data. The random <code>proposal_id</code> from the draft phase is not present in any hash-committed payload. This is not an implementation detail. It is the design.</p>
<p>Exploration is intentionally unconstrained because suggestions are not claims. Authority is explicitly bound because claims have consequences.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why the System Stops</h2>
<p>The demo produces three possible outcomes: <code>VERIFIED</code>, <code>REFUTED</code>, or <code>ABSTAINED</code>.</p>
<code>VERIFIED</code> means the claim was validated by the MV arithmetic validator. This is a limited-coverage procedural check, not a formal proof. See "Validator Coverage" below.
<code>REFUTED</code> means the claim was checked by the MV arithmetic validator and found to be false. Again, this is a procedural check with limited coverage.
<code>ABSTAINED</code> means the system did not find either. This is not a failure. This is the correct output when the system cannot establish the claim.
<h3>Validator Coverage (MV Arithmetic Validator)</h3>
<p>The MV validator in v0 has <strong>limited coverage</strong>:</p>
<table><tr><th>Covered</th><th>Not Covered</th></tr>
<tr><td>Integer arithmetic: <code>a op b = c</code> where op is +, -, *, /</td><td>Floating-point precision</td></tr>
<tr><td>Single equality assertions</td><td>Chained expressions (a + b + c)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Deterministic evaluation</td><td>Overflow behavior (uses Python semantics)</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Division by zero (returns ABSTAINED)</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Symbolic reasoning</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Any non-arithmetic claims</td></tr></table>
For the complete formal specification, see <a href="../mv-coverage/">MV Validator Coverage</a>.
<strong>What this means:</strong>
<ul><li><code>2 + 2 = 4</code> → VERIFIED (covered)</li><li><code>2 + 2 = 5</code> → REFUTED (covered)</li><li><code>sqrt(2) is irrational</code> → ABSTAINED (not covered: not arithmetic equality)</li><li><code>1e308 + 1e308 = inf</code> → ABSTAINED (not covered: float precision)</li><li><code>10 / 0 = undefined</code> → ABSTAINED (not covered: division by zero)</li></ul>
Claims outside validator coverage yield ABSTAINED, not VERIFIED or REFUTED.
<p>The system does not guess. It does not approximate. It does not hedge. When it cannot verify or refute, it stops and says so.</p>
<p>This stopping is correctness, not caution. A system that produces confident outputs when it lacks grounds for confidence is broken. A system that reports the limits of what it can establish is working as intended.</p>
<h3>Abstention as a Terminal Outcome</h3>
<strong>Rule:</strong> Once a claim artifact is classified as ABSTAINED, that outcome is final for that artifact within its claim identity and epoch.
<p>This is not a limitation. It is a design commitment. The system sacrifices:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Late upgrade:</strong> A claim that ABSTAINED cannot later become VERIFIED, even if a verifier is added.</li><li><strong>Institutional override:</strong> No human attestation, policy change, or governance decision can retroactively convert ABSTAINED to VERIFIED.</li><li><strong>Optimistic closure:</strong> The system cannot record "probably correct" or "likely valid" as a hedge.</li></ul>
These sacrifices are intentional. They exist because:
<ol><li>Replayability requires deterministic outcomes. If the same artifact could produce different outcomes under different regimes, evidence packs would be meaningless.</li><li>Audit trails must be immutable. A system that allows retroactive upgrades cannot be trusted to preserve its own history.</li><li>Abstention is information. It records what the system could not establish at the time of evaluation.</li></ol>
<strong>What this does NOT prevent:</strong>
<ul><li>Submitting a new artifact with the same claim text under a different trust class</li><li>Creating a new claim in a later epoch with enhanced verifier coverage</li><li>Documenting that a previously-abstained claim is now known to be valid (externally)</li></ul>
The original artifact remains sealed. New artifacts can be created. History is preserved.
<hr>
<h2>Why ADV Exists</h2>
<p>Claims in the demo have trust classes. Three of them (FV, MV, PA) are authority-bearing and can enter the reasoning attestation. One of them (ADV) cannot.</p>
<h3>Trust Class Reference (matches UI)</h3>
<table><tr><th>Class</th><th>UI Description</th><th>v0 Behavior</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>FV</strong></td><td>Formal proof</td><td>ABSTAINED (no prover; Lean/Z3 is Phase II)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>MV</strong></td><td>Mechanical validation</td><td>VERIFIED/REFUTED/ABSTAINED (arithmetic only)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>PA</strong></td><td>User attestation</td><td>ABSTAINED (authority noted, not mechanically verified)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>ADV</strong></td><td>Advisory</td><td>EXCLUDED FROM R_t (exploration only)</td></tr></table>
ADV stands for Advisory. It means: this is a suggestion, not a claim.
<p>The system is allowed to produce ADV content. It can speculate. It can offer best guesses. It can generate plausible-sounding statements. All of this is permitted in the exploration phase.</p>
<p>But ADV content is explicitly inert. It does not enter the reasoning root (R_t). It does not contribute to the attestation. It is recorded, but it has no authority.</p>
<p>This is not humility theater. The system is not pretending to be modest. It is making a structural distinction: suggestions exist, but they are not claims. The demo enforces this distinction at the data model level. ADV content cannot leak into authority-bearing paths because the code rejects it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What the Hashes Mean</h2>
<p>The demo produces three values: U_t, R_t, and H_t.</p>
<strong>U_t</strong> is the UI Merkle root. It commits to everything the human did: which claims they committed, which edits they made, which actions they took. If the human's actions change, U_t changes.
<strong>R_t</strong> is the Reasoning Merkle root. It commits to everything the system established: which claims were verified, which proofs were produced, which artifacts support those claims. If the system's reasoning changes, R_t changes.
<strong>H_t</strong> is the composite root. It binds U_t and R_t together. It represents the full state of what happened: human actions and system reasoning, tied to each other.
<p>These values are deterministic. Given the same inputs, the system produces the same hashes. If you run the demo twice with identical actions, you get identical values.</p>
<p>This enables two properties:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Replayability</strong>: Anyone with the inputs can verify the outputs.</li><li><strong>Non-silent drift</strong>: If the system's behavior changes, the hashes change. There is no way for the system to produce different outputs while claiming nothing changed.</li></ol>
You do not need to understand cryptography to use these values. You need to understand one thing: if the hash is the same, the content is the same. If the content changed, the hash changed.
<hr>
<h2>Evidence Pack + Replay Verification</h2>
<p>The demo provides audit-grade closure through evidence packs.</p>
<strong>What is an evidence pack?</strong>
<p>An evidence pack is a self-contained JSON file containing:
<ul><li>The committed partition snapshot (all claims and their trust classes)</li><li>UVIL events (what the human did)</li><li>Reasoning artifacts (what the system established)</li><li>The attestation hashes (U_t, R_t, H_t)</li><li>The formula note explaining how H_t is computed</li><li>Replay instructions for independent verification</li></ul>
<strong>Why evidence packs matter:</strong></p>
<p>Evidence packs enable independent verification. An auditor with the evidence pack can:
<ol><li>Recompute U_t from the UVIL events</li><li>Recompute R_t from the reasoning artifacts</li><li>Recompute H_t = SHA256(R_t || U_t)</li><li>Compare the computed values to the recorded values</li></ol>
If all three match, the attestation is verified. If any differ, something changed.</p>
<strong>No external calls required:</strong>
<p>Replay verification is fully local. The evidence pack contains everything needed. No API calls, no network access, no external dependencies. The computation is deterministic and reproducible.</p>
<strong>Tamper detection:</strong>
<p>If anyone modifies the evidence pack—changing a claim, altering a trust class, editing an artifact—the replay verification fails. The hashes will not match. There is no way to tamper with the evidence without detection.</p>
<strong>How to use:</strong>
<ol><li>After verification, click "Download Evidence Pack" to save the JSON file</li><li>Click "Replay & Verify" to recompute and compare hashes locally</li><li>A PASS result confirms the attestation is intact</li><li>A FAIL result shows which hashes diverged</li></ol>
This is the audit trail. Same inputs, same hashes, same evidence. Every time.
<strong>What replay does NOT prove:</strong>
<p>Replay verification proves structural integrity, not truth. A PASS result means: the recorded hashes match what the inputs produce. It does not mean: the claims are correct, the verification was sound, or the system behaved safely. The evidence pack proves the audit trail is intact. It proves nothing about what that trail represents.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What This Demo Refuses to Claim</h2>
<p>This demo does not claim the system is aligned with human values.</p>
<p>This demo does not claim the system is intelligent.</p>
<p>This demo does not claim the system is safe.</p>
<p>This demo does not claim the system will behave well in novel situations.</p>
<p>This demo claims one thing: the system's governance is legible. You can see what the human committed. You can see what the system established. You can see where the boundary is. You can verify that the boundary was not crossed.</p>
<p>That is all. Governance and epistemic legibility. Nothing else.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How to Read the Demo as Evidence</h2>
<strong>Justified conclusions:</strong>
<ul><li>The system separates exploration from authority at the data model level.</li><li>The system produces deterministic attestations for committed content.</li><li>The system refuses to include ADV content in authority-bearing paths.</li><li>The system stops and reports ABSTAINED when it cannot verify or refute.</li><li>The human's actions and the system's reasoning are recorded in separate, verifiable structures.</li></ul>
<strong>Explicitly not justified:</strong>
<ul><li>The system will behave correctly in all cases.</li><li>The system's verification is complete or sound in any formal sense.</li><li>The system's abstention is always appropriate.</li><li>The governance structure prevents all possible failures.</li><li>The demo generalizes to production systems.</li></ul>
The demo is evidence that a specific set of invariants are enforced in a specific implementation. It is not evidence of anything beyond that.
<hr>
<h2>If This Feels Restrictive, That Is the Point</h2>
<p>The demo does less than you might expect. It stops when it could guess. It refuses to promote ADV content. It separates phases that could be merged. It records hashes that could be omitted.</p>
<p>These restrictions are not limitations to be overcome. They are the design.</p>
<p>A system that does more than it can justify is not more capable. It is less trustworthy. A system that clearly reports its boundaries is not weaker. It is legible.</p>
<p>The demo is shaped this way because the alternative—a system that blurs the line between suggestion and claim, between exploration and authority, between what it knows and what it guesses—is worse. Not harder to build. Worse.</p>
<p>This demo is boring. That is also the point.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Where the Demo Explains Itself in the UI</h2>
<p>As of v0.2.0, the demo includes integrated self-explanation that appears directly in the interface. This is not decorative. These explanations are structurally enforced via regression tests.</p>

<ul><li>Does NOT say "the system believes" (anthropomorphizing)</li><li>Does NOT say "verified correct" (overclaiming validator capability)</li><li>Does NOT say "safe" or "aligned" (capability claims)</li><li>Does NOT use emojis or exclamation marks (false enthusiasm)</li><li>Does NOT promise future capabilities (scope creep)</li></ul>
The copy style is deliberately flat. It explains what happens, not what it means for safety or alignment.

<h2>Two-Lane Architecture</h2>
<strong>Status: LOCKED for v0.2.13</strong>
<p>MathLedger operates on a two-lane architecture that separates certified authority from exploratory reasoning.</p>
<h3>Lane A: MathLedger Core (Authority Lane)</h3>
<p>Lane A is the certification authority. It contains:
<ul><li>Committed claim artifacts with immutable identifiers</li><li>Attestation hashes (U_t, R_t, H_t)</li><li>Verification outcomes (VERIFIED, REFUTED, ABSTAINED)</li><li>Evidence packs with replay instructions</li></ul>
Lane A content is deterministic, versioned, and cryptographically bound. Once a claim enters Lane A, its identifier and outcome are sealed.</p>
<h3>Lane B: Exploratory / Agent Audit (Discovery Lane)</h3>
<p>Lane B is the exploration space. It is a <strong>design pattern and planned product lane</strong>, not a fully shipped capability.</p>
<strong>Currently implemented:</strong>
<ul><li>Draft proposals with random identifiers</li><li>Suggested trust class assignments</li><li>ADV (Advisory) claims</li><li>Limited sandbox artifacts and advisory notes</li></ul>
<strong>Planned (not yet shipped):</strong>
<ul><li>Agent Audit Kit for systematic exploration</li><li>Structured hypothesis testing pipelines</li><li>Multi-agent coordination artifacts</li></ul>
Lane B content is mutable and non-authoritative. It serves as a staging area for human-agent interaction before commitment.
<h3>Architectural Invariant: Unidirectional Flow</h3>
<strong>Lane B never directly writes to Lane A.</strong>
<p>The only mechanism for Lane B content to influence Lane A is through explicit human commitment via the UVIL (User-Verified Input Loop). At commitment:
<ol><li>The random proposal identifier is discarded</li><li>A new content-derived identifier is computed</li><li>The exploratory artifact is transformed into an authority-bearing artifact</li></ol>
This is analogous to the relationship between a wind tunnel and a certification authority in aerospace engineering. The wind tunnel (Lane B) generates data and tests hypotheses. The certification authority (Lane A) records what has been established. Test data does not automatically become certification. Certification requires explicit act, documented transition, and sealed record.</p>

<h2>ACE Methodology + Ordered-Pairs</h2>
<p>MathLedger evaluates claims through the <strong>ACE (Admissible Claim Engine)</strong> using ordered-pair structures.</p>
<p>The ACE operates in three phases:
<ul><li><strong>A — Admissibility</strong>: Is the claim eligible for authority?</li><li><strong>C — Commitment</strong>: Has the claim been explicitly committed by a human?</li><li><strong>E — Evaluation</strong>: What did the declared verification route produce?</li></ul>
<h3>Ordered-Pair Structure: (Claim Artifact, Verification Route)</h3></p>
<p>Every authority-bearing claim in MathLedger is represented as an ordered pair:</p>
<pre><code class="language-">(Claim Artifact, Verification Route)
</code></pre>
<p>Where:
<ul><li><strong>Claim Artifact</strong>: The specific textual or formal content being asserted</li><li><strong>Verification Route</strong>: The declared method by which the claim will be evaluated (FV, MV, PA)</li></ul>
The same claim artifact evaluated under different verification routes produces different claim identities. The pair is the unit of authority, not the claim text alone.</p>
<h3>Claim Identity Computation</h3>
<p>The claim_id commits to all identity-bearing components:</p>
<pre><code class="language-">claim_id = Hash(domain || normalized_claim || verification_route_id || schema_version)
</code></pre>
<p>The verification route is part of identity to prevent <strong>retroactive route laundering</strong> — an attack where an adversary could claim a different verification path was used after observing the outcome.</p>
<h3>ACE Phase Details</h3>
<strong>Admissibility (A)</strong>: A claim is admissible if and only if it declares a verification route. ADV (Advisory) claims explicitly declare "no route" and are therefore inadmissible for authority. They are recorded but excluded from R_t.
<strong>Commitment (C)</strong>: A claim becomes authority-bearing only at explicit human commitment. Before commitment, it exists in the exploratory lane. After commitment, it receives a content-derived identifier and enters the attestation structure.
<strong>Evaluation (E)</strong>: The declared verification route determines how the claim is evaluated:
<ul><li>FV: Formal proof required (ABSTAINED in v0; no prover implemented)</li><li>MV: Mechanical validation (arithmetic only in v0)</li><li>PA: Procedural attestation (human attests; ABSTAINED for mechanical verification)</li></ul>
<h3>Why No Claim Becomes Authoritative Without a Declared Route</h3>
<p>This constraint prevents silent authority inflation. Without explicit route declaration:
<ul><li>The system cannot know how to evaluate the claim</li><li>Auditors cannot verify the evaluation was appropriate</li><li>Retroactive route assignment would enable outcome manipulation</li></ul>
The ordered-pair structure makes verification route a first-class component of claim identity, not a post-hoc annotation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Epistemic Invariants</h2>
<p>The following invariants govern authority, abstention, and replay in MathLedger.</p>
<h3>Terminal Abstention</h3>
<strong>Definition</strong>: Once a claim artifact is classified as ABSTAINED, that outcome is final for that <code>claim_id</code> within its verification route and epoch.
<strong>Scope</strong>: ABSTAINED is terminal for that specific <code>claim_id</code> (which includes the route and schema version). The same claim <em>text</em> may be re-asserted later, but only as a <strong>new <code>claim_id</code></strong> by:
<ul><li>Changing the verification route, or</li><li>Submitting in a new epoch, or</li><li>Using a new schema version</li></ul>
This produces a new auditable object with its own outcome. The original ABSTAINED artifact remains sealed and visible.
<strong>What this preserves</strong>: No retroactive upgrade. The system cannot silently improve historical outcomes. If verifier coverage expands, new claims benefit; old claims do not change.
<strong>What this does NOT prevent</strong>:
<ul><li>Re-asserting the same claim text under a different route (new claim_id)</li><li>Creating new claims in later epochs with enhanced coverage</li><li>External documentation that a previously-abstained claim is now known to be valid</li></ul>
<h3>ADV Class Quarantine</h3>
<strong>Definition</strong>: Claims assigned the ADV (Advisory) trust class are structurally excluded from R_t (the reasoning attestation root).
<strong>Structural enforcement</strong>: ADV artifacts may appear in:
<ul><li>The evidence bundle (for transparency)</li><li>The UI root U_t (as user interaction records)</li></ul>
But ADV artifacts <strong>must not</strong> contribute to R_t, and therefore cannot affect H_t via the R_t path. ADV claims cannot become authority-bearing through any code path.
<strong>Enforcement</strong>: The R_t computation explicitly filters out ADV claims. This is not a policy decision; it is a data model constraint enforced by the attestation code.
<h3>Monotonic Epistemic Time</h3>
<strong>Definition</strong>: Verification outcomes cannot be retroactively upgraded. Time flows forward through epochs; no mechanism exists for backward revision.
<strong>Implication</strong>: A claim that was ABSTAINED in epoch T cannot be marked VERIFIED in epoch T retrospectively. New verification requires a new claim in epoch T+1 (which produces a new claim_id).
<strong>Constraint</strong>: This prevents historical revision attacks where an adversary could claim earlier validation of content that was not established at the time.
<h3>Invariant Conflict Preservation (Design Grief)</h3>
<strong>Definition</strong>: When implementing a system obligation creates conflict with another obligation, both the choice and the sacrifice are documented.
<strong>Implication</strong>: MathLedger does not silently resolve design tensions. When invariants conflict, the resolution is explicit: which invariant was prioritized, which was deferred, and why. This is called "design grief."
<strong>Purpose</strong>: Preserves intellectual honesty about system limitations. Prevents false claims of comprehensive coverage. Documents the actual tradeoff space.
<h3>Bidirectional Accountability</h3>
<strong>Definition</strong>: Human actions and system reasoning are bound via hash commitment. U_t commits to what the human did; R_t commits to what the system established; H_t binds both.
<strong>Implication</strong>: Neither party can unilaterally modify the record. If the human's actions change, U_t changes. If the system's reasoning changes, R_t changes. If either changes, H_t changes.
<strong>Enforcement</strong>: Evidence packs include both UVIL events (human) and reasoning artifacts (system). Replay verification recomputes all three hashes. Any tampering on either side is detectable.

<h2>Demo Scope Justification</h2>
<h3>Why the Demo Is Intentionally Minimal</h3>
<p>This demo demonstrates governance substrate, not capability. It is designed to be boring.</p>
<strong>What the demo shows:</strong>
<ul><li>Separation of exploration from authority</li><li>Trust class routing</li><li>Deterministic attestation</li><li>Replay verification</li><li>Explicit abstention</li></ul>
<strong>What the demo does not show:</strong>
<ul><li>Formal proof verification (no Lean/Z3 integration)</li><li>Comprehensive mechanical validation (arithmetic only)</li><li>Production-scale throughput</li><li>Novel reasoning capabilities</li></ul>
This is intentional. The demo exists to prove that governance invariants can be enforced, not that the system is capable.
<h3>Prevention of Authority Inflation</h3>
<p>Authority inflation occurs when a system's claimed capabilities exceed its actual verification coverage. This demo prevents authority inflation through:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Explicit validator coverage</strong>: The MV validator handles <code>a op b = c</code> patterns only. All other patterns yield ABSTAINED.</li><li><strong>No implicit promotion</strong>: ADV content cannot silently become authority-bearing.</li><li><strong>Terminal abstention</strong>: Claims that cannot be verified remain permanently marked as such (for that claim_id).</li><li><strong>Forbidden claims list</strong>: The demo includes regression tests that detect capability overclaims.</li></ol>
<h3>Auditability Over Impressiveness</h3>
<p>The demo prioritizes auditability over impressiveness:</p>
<ul><li>Every outcome is deterministic and reproducible</li><li>Every attestation is independently verifiable</li><li>Every boundary is explicit and documented</li><li>Every refusal is explained</li></ul>
A demo that impresses evaluators with capability while obscuring its verification basis is worse than a demo that clearly reports what it can and cannot establish. This demo chooses legibility over performance.
<h3>What This Scope Implies for Evaluators</h3>
<p>If you are evaluating this demo for:
<ul><li><strong>Capability</strong>: You will be disappointed. The demo does very little.</li><li><strong>Auditability</strong>: You should be able to verify every claim the demo makes about itself.</li><li><strong>Governance</strong>: You should be able to trace every authority-bearing artifact to its commitment point and verification route.</li></ul>
The demo is evidence that a specific governance architecture is implementable. It is not evidence of alignment, safety, or intelligence. It makes no such claims.</p>

<p>For external reviewers verifying the demo independently:</p>
<h3>Step 1: Run the drop-in demo</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv run python scripts/run_dropin_demo.py --seed 42 --output demo_output/
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 2: Run verification</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd demo_output && python verify.py
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 3: Expected output</h3>
<pre><code class="language-">[PASS] Composite root verified: H_t == SHA256(R_t || U_t)
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 4: Artifacts produced</h3>
<p>Confirm the following files exist in <code>demo_output/</code>:
<ul><li><code>verify.py</code> — Self-contained verifier</li><li><code>evidence_pack.json</code> — Complete audit artifact</li><li><code>manifest.json</code> — Execution metadata</li><li><code>u_t.txt</code> — UI Merkle root</li><li><code>r_t.txt</code> — Reasoning Merkle root</li><li><code>h_t.txt</code> — Composite root</li></ul>
<h3>Step 5: Verify claim outcomes</h3></p>
<p>In the evidence pack, confirm:
<ul><li>Claim outcomes include VERIFIED, REFUTED, and/or ABSTAINED as appropriate</li><li>ADV claims (if any) are present in the bundle but excluded from R_t computation</li><li>All authority-bearing claims have a declared verification route</li></ul>
<h3>Step 6: Replay with different seed</h3></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv run python scripts/run_dropin_demo.py --seed 43 --output demo_output_43/
cd demo_output_43 && python verify.py
</code></pre>
<p>Confirm: different seed produces different hashes, but verification still passes.</p>
