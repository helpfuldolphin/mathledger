## Latent Pressure Candidates (Not Activated)

### Continual Learning vs No Silent Authority

**Context:**
Speculative claims (unverified) suggest that deployed LLM systems may eventually support persistent or continual learning across sessions.

**Relevance:**
If persistent learning becomes real, it directly collides with MathLedger's core obligation:
"No Silent Authority" — nothing may influence durable learning without explicit, inspectable attestation.

**Potential collision:**
- Persistent learning encourages silent accumulation of state.
- MathLedger requires all durable state transitions to be artifact-bound, versioned, and auditable.
- This creates tension between adaptivity and epistemic legibility.

**Status:**
Awareness only.
Not a claim.
Not an obligation.
Not included in fm.tex.

**Activation condition:**
Only activate if:
- Persistent learning is demonstrably deployed in production systems, AND
- MathLedger chooses to address learning-over-time as a first-class concern.

**Until then:**
This remains parked.
