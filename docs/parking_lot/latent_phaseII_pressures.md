# Latent Phase II Pressures

Internal awareness log. Not public. Not escalation.

## 2026-01-04 — Abstention Terminality (v0.2.9)

Abstention terminality resolved cleanly under hostile audit.
Future collisions likely with institutional completeness expectations.

## 2026-01-06 — Statistical Admissibility vs Constitutive Admissibility

**Pressing level:** Medium

**Context:**
Increasing industry reliance on distributional policy evaluation (e.g., MAP-AI) creates pressure to equate probabilistic acceptability with admissible authority.

**Collision:**
MAP-AI represents a growing industry pressure to treat probabilistic acceptability as governance. MathLedger must explicitly guard against this collapse.

**Position:**
MathLedger must remain fail-closed against purely statistical admissibility. Probabilistic acceptability is not constitutive authority.

## 2026-01-06 — Causal Faithfulness Audits

**Pressing level:** Low (conceptual, no deterministic judge exists)

**Context:**
Causal faithfulness audits for explanation traces (Ariadne-style do-interventions) — keep as advisory until a deterministic judge exists.

See `ariadne_faithfulness_pressure.md` for full pressure analysis.

## 2026-01-06 — Verification-Value Paradox

**Pressing level:** Medium-High (affects value proposition in professional domains)

**Context:**
Net value N = EG − V. In high-duty domains (law, medicine, finance), verification cost V is non-negotiable and broad in scope. If MathLedger does not reduce V via MV routes, efficiency gains are neutralized.

**Collision:**
Phase II must prioritize MV-route expansion and replayable evidence packs. ADV/PA routes do not reduce V; they document that verification was not performed mechanically.

**Position:**
Reduce verification cost V via additional MV verifiers and replayable evidence packs; else net value collapses in high-duty domains.

**Reference:**
See `verification_value_paradox_pressure.md` for full analysis.

## 2026-01-06 — Post-Task Governance for Skill-Composed Artifacts

**Pressing level:** Medium (grows with agent capability benchmarks)

**Context:**
As agents complete multi-skill tasks successfully (SkillsBench-style benchmarks), governance must distinguish "task success" from "claim admissibility," especially for enterprise/legal artifacts.

**Collision:**
- Task completion is a capability metric, not a trust signal
- Artifacts produced by successful agent runs inherit no trust class by default
- Enterprise users may treat "agent completed task" as implicit authority

**Position:**
Phase II must define how skill-composed artifacts acquire trust class. Default: ADV (advisory) until explicit MV verification route exists for artifact type.

## 2026-01-07 — Probabilistic Claims and Forecasting

**Pressing level:** Medium (grows with enterprise demand for uncertainty quantification)

**Context:**
Forecasting and calibrated uncertainty outputs (OpenForesight-style) create pressure for a standard PA route for probabilistic claims. Users will demand that calibration become a governance artifact, not just an accuracy metric.

**Collision:**
- MathLedger currently handles binary outcomes; probabilistic claims require new route semantics
- Calibration without replay bundles is unverifiable
- Leakage control (retrieval cutoffs, corpus versioning) becomes a reproducibility constraint

**Position:**
Phase II needs a standard PA route for probabilistic outputs with:
- Explicit confidence semantics (0.0–1.0)
- Resolution source and criteria pinning
- Temporal cutoff enforcement (leakage prevention)
- Replay bundles for probabilistic claims
