Nenad,

Following up on our earlier conversation about verifiable learning substrates.

Two items are now available if useful:

1. **arXiv draft** — "Reflexive Formal Learning: A Verifiable Learning Substrate with Ledger-Attested Feedback"
   - Formalizes the RFL framework
   - Includes calibration experiment results (CAL-EXP-3)
   - Located at: `docs/PAPERS/arxiv/main.tex`

2. **Replayable demo** — Single-command demonstration of the governance substrate
   - Runs offline, no dependencies beyond Python/uv
   - Verifies determinism, dual attestation, fail-close behavior
   - Takes <10 minutes to run and verify
   - Command: `uv run python scripts/run_dropin_demo.py --seed 42`

Both are frozen and stable. No pressure to review — just noting availability in case relevant to ongoing work.

Best,
[Name]

## Notes for Sender

- Do not add urgency or ask for commitment
- Do not mention acquisition, valuation, or timeline
- Do not promise capabilities beyond what is demonstrated
- If no response, do not follow up aggressively
- The goal is availability awareness, not conversion
