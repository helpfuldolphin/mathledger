Nenad,

Following up on our earlier exchange in case this is useful.

Two materials are now available:

1. **Replayable governance demo**
   - Single-command, offline demonstration of the governance substrate
   - Verifies determinism, dual attestation, and fail-closed behavior
   - Produces a self-contained audit bundle with independent replay
   - Takes <10 minutes to run end-to-end
   - Command: `uv run python scripts/run_dropin_demo.py --seed 42`

2. **arXiv draft**
   - "Reflexive Formal Learning: A Verifiable Learning Substrate with Ledger-Attested Feedback"
   - Formalizes the learning rule and governance framing
   - Documents Phase I infrastructure validation (no capability claims)

Both artifacts are frozen and stable. No pressure to review — just noting availability in case it intersects with ongoing work.

Best,
Ismail

## Notes for Sender

- Do not add urgency or ask for commitment
- Do not mention acquisition, valuation, or timeline
- Do not promise capabilities beyond what is demonstrated
- If no response, do not follow up aggressively
- The goal is availability awareness, not conversion
- Demo is primary object; paper is secondary (formalization, not proof)
