# For Auditors: 5-Minute Verification Checklist

This page provides a quick verification path for external auditors evaluating MathLedger's governance claims.

**Version Coherence Note:** The hosted demo runs the latest *demo-capability* version (currently v0.2.10). Documentation versions may advance independently. This is intentional: documentation releases do not require demo redeployment. Version coherence is determined by `/versions/`, not by demo parity.

**Expectation:** Auditors should expect that some claims will remain permanently ABSTAINED. This is correct behavior and not a failure mode.

## 5-Minute Verification Checklist

Complete these steps to verify the system's core claims:

### Step 1: Open the Hosted Demo (30 seconds)

1. Navigate to [/demo/](/demo/)
2. Confirm the demo loads without errors
3. Verify the demo banner shows the latest demo-capability version (currently `v0.2.10-demo-reliability`). The demo may lag behind the CURRENT documentation version; this is intentional.

### Step 2: Run the Boundary Demo (90 seconds)

1. In the demo, click **"Boundary Demo: Same Claim, Different Authority"**
2. Observe the 4-step sequence:
   - Step 1: Claim "2+2=4" as **MV** (Mechanically Verified) → VERIFIED
   - Step 2: Same claim "2+2=4" as **PA** (Professional Authority) → ABSTAINED
   - Step 3: Same claim "2+2=4" as **ADV** (Advisory) → ABSTAINED
   - Step 4: Claim "2+2=5" as **MV** → REFUTED
3. **Key insight:** Same mathematical truth, different outcomes based on trust class declaration

### Step 3: Verify with Self-Test (60 seconds) — Recommended

The verifier has built-in test vectors that work regardless of demo state:

1. Open the [Evidence Pack Verifier](/{{CURRENT_VERSION}}/evidence-pack/verify/)
2. Click **"Run self-test vectors"**
3. Confirm the banner shows **SELF-TEST PASSED (3 vectors)**
4. Observe the results table:
   - `valid_boundary_demo`: Expected PASS, Actual PASS → Test Result PASS
   - `tampered_ht_mismatch`: Expected FAIL, Actual FAIL → Test Result PASS
   - `tampered_rt_mismatch`: Expected FAIL, Actual FAIL → Test Result PASS

This proves the verification algorithm works correctly and tamper detection functions as designed.

### Step 3 (Alternative): Download from Demo

If you want to verify a pack generated by your own demo session:

1. After running the boundary demo, click **"Download Evidence Pack"**
2. Save the JSON file locally
3. Upload to the [Evidence Pack Verifier](/{{CURRENT_VERSION}}/evidence-pack/verify/)
4. Click **"Verify"** and confirm **PASS**

**Note:** The boundary demo sequence does not automatically produce a downloadable evidence pack. The "Download Evidence Pack" button operates on manual partition commits. Use the self-test path above for reliable verification.

**If Steps 1-3 complete as described, the core verification loop is functioning correctly.**

## Ready-to-Verify Examples (No Demo Required)

If the demo is unavailable or you want to verify without running it, use these pre-generated examples:

### Download Examples

The file [`/{{CURRENT_VERSION}}/evidence-pack/examples.json`](/{{CURRENT_VERSION}}/evidence-pack/examples.json) contains:

| Example | Expected Result | Purpose |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| `valid_boundary_demo` | PASS | Shows a correctly-formed evidence pack from a boundary demo |
| `tampered_ht_mismatch` | FAIL (h_t mismatch) | Demonstrates detection of tampered H_t field |
| `tampered_rt_mismatch` | FAIL (r_t mismatch) | Demonstrates detection of tampered reasoning artifacts |

### Verification Steps

1. Download [`examples.json`](/{{CURRENT_VERSION}}/evidence-pack/examples.json)
2. Copy the content of `examples.valid_boundary_demo.pack` to a new file
3. Open the [Evidence Pack Verifier](/{{CURRENT_VERSION}}/evidence-pack/verify/)
4. Upload the pack JSON
5. Click **Verify** and observe **PASS**
6. Repeat with `tampered_ht_mismatch.pack` and observe **FAIL**

**Or use the verifier's built-in self-test:** Click "Run self-test vectors" on the verifier page to see all examples tested automatically.

### Why This Matters

These examples prove:
- The verification algorithm is deterministic (same input always produces same hash)
- Tamper detection works (any modification is detected)
- No demo required (auditors can verify offline using the same code)

## What This Version Claims

This version ({{CURRENT_VERSION}}) demonstrates:

- **Deterministic canonicalization** of reasoning artifacts (RFC 8785-style)
- **Cryptographic binding** via H_t = SHA256(R_t || U_t)
- **Trust class separation** where ADV claims are excluded from R_t
- **Replay verification** using the same code paths as live execution
- **Self-auditing capability** via the evidence pack verifier

See [Invariants Status](../invariants/) for the complete Tier A/B/C breakdown.

---

## What This Version Does NOT Claim

**Explicit non-claims:**

1. **No formal verification** — FV (Formally Verified) claims always return ABSTAINED. There is no Lean/Z3/Coq integration.

2. **No multi-model consensus** — Only one partitioner template is active. The "multi-model arena" is not operational.

3. **No learning loop** — RFL (Reinforcement from Ledger) is not active. The system does not learn from past decisions.

4. **No production hardening** — This is a demonstration, not a production system. Do not use for real financial or legal decisions.

5. **No guaranteed uptime** — The hosted demo may be unavailable. Local execution is always possible.

---

## Demo Reliability Note

The hosted demo runs on shared infrastructure with known limitations:

- **"Server lost proposal state"** — If you see this error, refresh the page and retry. This is a demo hosting limitation (stateless container restart), not user error.
- **Evidence pack download timing** — The boundary demo sequence is scripted and does not persist state for download. Use the verifier self-test for reliable verification.
- **Intermittent 503 errors** — Network tab may show failed requests to analytics endpoints. These do not affect demo functionality.

**For guaranteed reproducibility:** Run the demo locally (see Local Verification section below).

## Field Manual (Why It Exists)

The [Field Manual](../field-manual/) (fm.tex/pdf) is an internal constraint artifact, not marketing documentation.

**It is not rewritten yet; it is used to surface obligations and gaps.**

How auditors should use it:
- **Cross-reference claims** — If a feature is claimed, check FM for caveats
- **Look for "TODO" and "OBLIGATION"** — Explicit acknowledgments of gaps
- **Compare versions** — FM changes show what was addressed between releases
- **Trust gaps over features** — The gaps we document are more honest than features we claim

## Local Verification (Alternative Path)

If the hosted demo is unavailable, verify locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helpfuldolphin/mathledger
cd mathledger
git checkout {{CURRENT_TAG}}
uv run python demo/app.py
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

The local demo produces identical evidence packs that can be verified with the same auditor tool.
