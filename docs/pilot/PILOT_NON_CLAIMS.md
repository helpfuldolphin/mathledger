## What the Pilot DOES Demonstrate

The pilot demonstrates **only**:

| Property | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| Artifact existence | Files are produced |
| Hash integrity | Composite root equation verifies |
| Determinism | Same seed produces identical output |
| Replayability | Inputs/outputs captured for external replay |
| SHADOW mode operation | Observational, non-blocking execution |
