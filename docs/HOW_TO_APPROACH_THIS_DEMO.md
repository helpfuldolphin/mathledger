# How to Approach This Demo

This demo will stop more often than you expect. It will decline to answer questions it could plausibly address. It will report that it cannot verify claims that seem straightforward. It will produce outputs that say "I do not know" when other systems would produce confident responses.

This stopping is an output, not a failure. When the demo reports that it cannot establish a claim, that report is the correct behavior. The system is working. It is telling you what it can and cannot do. A system that guesses when it lacks grounds is not more helpful. It is less honest.

The goal of this demo is not to be impressive. It does not aim to produce surprising results, clever responses, or demonstrations of capability. It aims to be legible. You should be able to see what the system established, what the human committed, and where the boundary between them lies. That is the entire purpose.

Do not conclude from this demo that the underlying system is aligned, safe, or intelligent. Do not conclude that the governance structure prevents all failures. Do not conclude that the mechanisms shown here generalize to other domains or scales. The demo demonstrates a specific set of enforced boundaries in a specific implementation. It is evidence of that and nothing more.

If you are looking for a system that always has an answer, this demo is not it.
