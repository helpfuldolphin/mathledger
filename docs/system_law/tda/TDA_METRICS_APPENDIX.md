### TDA Metrics Appendix

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) provides a crucial layer of abstraction for validating system safety. While raw USLA state vectors offer a high-dimensional, coordinate-dependent snapshot of the system, TDA metrics characterize the underlying shape and structure of the system's dynamic manifold. Metrics such as Path Connectivity (PCS) and Dimensionality Reduction Stability (DRS) are coordinate-free; they are invariant to rotation, translation, and scaling of the state space. This property makes them robust indicators of qualitative changes in system behavior that might be obscured by local noise or complex coordinate interdependencies. The core safety proposition is that TDA acts as a sanity check on the global topology of the system's dynamics, ensuring that the system does not drift into unforeseen, unstable, or disconnected regions of its state space that might otherwise be missed by purely state-based error monitoring.
