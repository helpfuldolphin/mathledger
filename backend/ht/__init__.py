HT (Hypothesis Tracking) Layer

This module manages hypothesis tracking and truth anchor validation for
the MathLedger structural governance system.

TODO[CLAUDE-G-Structural]: Implement HT structural layer
    Required components for structural governance integration:
      1. HypothesisRegistry class - Track hypotheses with verification status
      2. TruthAnchorValidator class - Validate Lean verification + attestations
      3. Integration with DAG lineage - Link hypotheses to proof paths
    See: docs/system_law/Structural_Cohesion_PhaseX.md Section 2.3

    Invariants to support:
      - SI-010: Truth Anchor Integrity (blocking for P4 admissibility)

    Status: STUB ONLY (requires implementation authorization)
