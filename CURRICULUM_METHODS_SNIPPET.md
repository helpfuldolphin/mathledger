The curriculum design for the Foundation Ontology (FO) experiments employed two primary slice configurations: `atoms5-depth6` for baseline evaluation and a wider, more challenging `slice_hard` (defined as `atoms7-depth12`) for stress-testing. These slices represent specific granularities and logical depths within the ontology, designed to probe distinct aspects of the system's foundational reasoning capabilities. Only the first-organism-pl slice was used in Phase I runs; the wide slices remain unexecuted. It is important to note that while easy, medium, and hard curriculum regimes are conceptualized for subsequent Phase II research and development, their full execution and rigorous evaluation have not yet been performed in the current experimental phase. This initial approach focuses on establishing robust performance boundaries with the selected slices. Any references to atoms7-depth12 are conceptual Roadmap items.
