\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

This section details the experimental methodology employed to evaluate the \projectname{} system. Our primary focus is on assessing the operational characteristics of the system under various configurations, particularly concerning the RFL (Reflective Feedback Loop) mechanism and the PL (Ponderation Layer) slicing.

\subsection{Test Harness}
Experiments are conducted within a dedicated FO (Feedback-Optimized) cycle harness. This harness simulates realistic operating conditions, allowing for precise control over input parameters and comprehensive capture of output metrics. The harness is designed to ensure reproducibility and provide a consistent environment for comparative analysis.

\subsection{Configurations Under Test}
We evaluate several key configurations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{RFL vs. Baseline:} We compare the performance of the \projectname{} system with the RFL mechanism enabled against a baseline configuration where RFL is disabled or replaced with a static control mechanism. This comparison aims to characterize the behavior of feedback mechanisms on system stability and output.
    \item \textbf{PL Slice Analysis:} The system's behavior is further investigated by varying the slicing of the Ponderation Layer. Different PL slice configurations are tested to understand their influence on computational efficiency, decision-making latency, and overall ledger integrity.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Measurement Metrics}
The following key metrics are recorded and analyzed during the experimental runs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Abstention Rate:} The frequency at which the system abstains from making a definitive judgment.
    \item \textbf{\Ht{} Dynamics:} We meticulously track the evolution and stability of the \Ht{} (Hypothesis Trajectory) dynamics over time, providing insights into the system's state processes.
    \item \textbf{Simple Capability Metrics:} A suite of fundamental performance indicators, including transaction processing speed, error rates, and resource utilization, are measured to establish a foundational understanding of system capabilities.
\end{itemize}
