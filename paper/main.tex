\title{\textbf{\projectname}: Reflexive Formal Learning and Dual-Attestation Substrate for Verifiable Machine Cognition}
\author{The MathLedger Research Fleet}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

    We present \projectname, a novel substrate for verifiable machine cognition integrating Reflexive Formal Learning (\RFL) and Dual-Attestation.

    Phase I experiments were conducted to establish baseline operational characteristics.

    The system's integrity was validated through a \valMirrorCoverage\% coverage mirror audit.

\end{abstract}

\section*{Phase Status}

\textbf{Phase I} established the core RFL infrastructure and validated it through a negative control experiment. The First Organism closed-loop test demonstrated deterministic execution and dual-root attestation, but produced no measurable uplift---as expected for a symmetric (path-invariant) environment.

\textbf{Phase II U2} defines a family of preregistered experiments on four asymmetric uplift slices (goal-conditioned, sparse-reward, chain-depth, multi-subgoal). These experiments are designed to test whether learned policies can reduce epistemic risk relative to random baselines.

\textbf{As of Evidence Pack v1 and the current commit, no uplift claims are made.} All uplift-related content represents design, theory, or preregistration---not empirical results.

\section{Discussion}

\label{sec:discussion}

Phase I experiments aimed to characterize the behavior of the \projectname{} substrate under various configurations. The \Ht{} dynamics (Figure \ref{fig:rfl_ht_convergence}) were observed to understand system states.



\section{Future Work}

\label{sec:future_work}

Future work will focus on evaluating whether RFL can produce measurable uplift in stability and performance. Phase II U2 experiments are preregistered to test if reflexive feedback can dampen oscillatory states in the decision boundary and achieve measurable reductions in abstention rates under asymmetric slice conditions. These experiments are planned but not yet executed; no uplift has been demonstrated as of this writing.



\section{Conclusion}

\label{sec:conclusion}

Phase I successfully established baseline operational parameters for the \projectname{} system.
