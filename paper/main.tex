\title{\textbf{\projectname}: Reflexive Formal Learning and Dual-Attestation Substrate for Verifiable Machine Cognition}
\author{The MathLedger Research Fleet}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

    We present \projectname, a novel substrate for verifiable machine cognition integrating Reflexive Formal Learning (\RFL) and Dual-Attestation.

    Phase I experiments were conducted to establish baseline operational characteristics.

    The system's integrity was validated through a \valMirrorCoverage\% coverage mirror audit.

\section{Discussion}

\label{sec:discussion}

Phase I experiments aimed to characterize the behavior of the \projectname{} substrate under various configurations. The \Ht{} dynamics (Figure \ref{fig:rfl_ht_convergence}) were observed to understand system states.



\section{Future Work}

\label{sec:future_work}

Future work will focus on integrating RFL for measurable uplift in stability and performance. Specifically, the objective is to observe if reflexive feedback can dampen oscillatory states in the decision boundary and achieve measurable reductions in abstention rates and improvements in convergence latency.



\section{Conclusion}

\label{sec:conclusion}

Phase I successfully established baseline operational parameters for the \projectname{} system.
