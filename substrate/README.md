# Substrate

Core formal machinery for MathLedger. This package owns the reflexive substrate:

- Lean/Coq/SMT sources and supporting build metadata
- Canonical abstract syntax trees and foundational schemas
- Formal proofs and invariants referenced by higher layers

All code and assets placed here must be reproducible and versioned via deterministic manifests.
