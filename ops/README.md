# Ops

Operational tooling, automation, and infrastructure definitions belong here:

- Operator scripts and runbooks (`ops/scripts/`)
- CI, validation, and benchmarking harnesses (`ops/checks/`)
- Deployment and infrastructure manifests (`ops/infra/`)
- Activity logs and decisions (`ops/logs/`)

Every script must be idempotent, traceable, and documented in the restructure log.
