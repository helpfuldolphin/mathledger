# SPRINT STATUS: RFL EXPERIMENT CAMPAIGN

**Date:** 2025-11-27  
**Coordinator:** GEMINI-O (Manus D Backup)  
**Phase:** Tier 2 Execution / Tier 3 Verification  

---

## 🚦 Executive Summary
The fleet is currently in **Active Research Mode**. Tier 1 (Foundation) is stable with `NO_NETWORK` discipline enforced. Tier 2 (Execution) is generating data, with `metrics_*.md` reports appearing in `reports/`. We are transitioning into deeper Tier 3 (Verification) tasks, specifically Abstention Analysis.

**Current Lock:** VCP 2.2 Protocols Active.
**Next Gate:** Completion of Abstention Analysis for Tier 4 Synthesis.

## 🤖 Agent Roster Status

| Agent Group | Representative | Status | Current Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foundation (Tier 1)** | Devin G / B / F | 🟢 **STABLE** | CI optimization complete, Security audit passed. |
| **Execution (Tier 2)** | Claude A / FO Runner | 🟡 **ACTIVE** | Generating proof traces. `metrics` reports updating. |
| **Verification (Tier 3)** | Devin C / Cursor C | 🟡 **ACTIVE** | Awaiting full FO Runner traces for **Abstention Analysis**. |
| **Coordination (Tier 4)** | Manus D / Devin I | 🔵 **PENDING** | Awaiting upstream data for **Figure Catalog**. |

---

## 🚧 Critical Blockers
1.  **Abstention Analysis Dependency:** Tier 3 cannot complete Abstention Analysis until FO Runner (Tier 2) confirms trace completion for the current batch.
2.  **Figure Catalog Prerequisite:** Capability Metrics must be finalized by Tier 3 before Tier 4 can generate the Figure Catalog.

---

## 📋 Next Actions (72-Hour Burn)
1.  **FO Runner:** Complete current batch of derivation traces.
2.  **Verification Agents:** Begin preliminary Abstention Analysis on available data; flag any high-drift anomalies.
3.  **Coordination:** Monitor `artifacts/` for "ready" signal to trigger Figure Catalog generation.
