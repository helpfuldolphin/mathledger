# INVESTOR DECK: CORE SLIDES (Skeleton)

## Slide 1: The "Hallucination Wall" vs. The RFL Uplift (The Dyno Chart)
**Visual:** A 2D Line Chart.
*   **X-Axis:** Problem Complexity (Depth of Reasoning Steps).
*   **Y-Axis:** Verification Success Rate (%).
*   **Series A (Red - "Standard LLM"):** Starts high on simple tasks but plummets to **0%** as complexity increases (The "Wall").
*   **Series B (Gray - "MathLedger RFL"):** Also plummets to **0%** success, mirroring Series A, demonstrating hermetic determinism without capability uplift in Phase I.
*   **Annotation:** "The Deterministic Wall" — Highlighting that RFL Phase I validates hermetic determinism, not capability increase.
*   **Key Metric:** "Phase-I RFL produced zero uplift; abstention remained at 100%."

## Slide 2: The Chain of Verifiable Cognition (Architecture)
**Visual:** A Flow/System Diagram (Left-to-Right).
*   **Step 1: The Stochastic Brain:** An LLM proposes a logical step ($S_t$).
*   **Step 2: The Deterministic Gate (RFL):** The MathLedger Engine checks $S_t$ against axioms.
    *   *If Invalid:* Feedback Loop (Red Arrow) sends error back to LLM.
    *   *If Valid:* Step is hashed and committed.
*   **Step 3: The Dual-Attestation Ledger:**
    *   **Proof 1:** Mathematical validity of the step.
    *   **Proof 2:** Cryptographic consensus of the sequence (Merkle Root).
*   **Outcome:** An immutable "Certificate of Reasoning" attached to the final output.

## Slide 3: Scaling "Certainty" (Roadmap)
**Visual:** A Gantt Chart / Timeline.
*   **Phase 1 (Now): Propositional & First-Order Logic.**
    *   *Status:* **Phase I Result:** Zero uplift; abstention 100%. Validates hermetic determinism. **Requirement:** Phase II funding for imperfect-verifier learning and meaningful uplift.
    *   *Current Challenge:* Translating hermetic determinism into practical, verifiable capability.*   **Phase 2 (Q1-Q2 2026): Equational Theories & Program Synthesis.**
    *   *Goal:* Verified Code Generation.
    *   *Use Case:* Defect-free software shipping, Financial Modeling.
*   **Phase 3 (2027+): The Global Verifier Network.**
    *   *Goal:* Decentralized "Truth Layer" for the AI internet.
    *   *Use Case:* Universal API for verifying third-party agent outputs.
