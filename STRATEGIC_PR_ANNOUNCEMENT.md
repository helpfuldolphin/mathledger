# Strategic PR Differentiators Now Required - 100% Compliance by Next Sprint

## TL;DR
**Effective immediately**: All PRs must declare their strategic differentiator using tags [POA], [ASD], [RC], [ME], [IVL], [NSF], [FM]. Every PR is now a chapter in our acquisition narrative.

## Strategic Differentiator Framework

### Required Tags
- **[POA]** - Proof of Automation: Autonomous theorem proving capabilities
- **[ASD]** - Algorithmic Superiority Demonstration: Novel algorithmic approaches
- **[RC]** - Reliability & Correctness: System reliability and error handling
- **[ME]** - Metrics & Evidence: Measurable performance evidence
- **[IVL]** - Integration & Validation Layer: System integration and APIs
- **[NSF]** - Network Security & Forensics: Security and audit capabilities
- **[FM]** - Formal Methods: Mathematical rigor and verification

### PR Title Format
```
[TAG] type(scope): description with quantified impact

Examples:
[POA] feat(derive): implement guided derivation with 95% success rate
[ASD] perf(canon): optimize normalization reducing processing time by 40%
[RC] test(integration): achieve 90% test coverage for core derivation engine
```

### Strategic Impact Section Required
All PRs must include a Strategic Impact section in the description:
- **Differentiator Tag**: Selected tag and strategic value
- **Acquisition Narrative**: Competitive positioning advancement
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Specific metrics or capabilities gained
- **Doctrine Alignment**: Reference to core technical doctrine

## Enforcement Timeline
- **Week 1**: Soft enforcement with reviewer guidance
- **Week 2+**: Hard enforcement - PRs without differentiators will be rejected
- **Sprint Goal**: 100% compliance for all merged PRs
