# Archive

Deprecated, historical, or triaged assets move here for safe keeping:

- `archive/docs/` — superseded specifications and audit trails
- `archive/ui/` — legacy UI experiments
- `archive/artifacts/` — reproducible snapshots retained for reference
- `archive/triage/` — anomalous files pending investigation

Every archived item must be referenced from `ops/logs/2025-11-13-restructure.md` with context and a plan for deletion or revival.
